> tiny module for converting python docstrings into markdown

This module provides a command line tool for parsing Python files genearting sensible looking markdown with function definitions. It's extremely opinionated and rigid! But extremely easy to use. I wrote it because Sphinx and the other documentation building frameworks for Python are complicated, involve a lot of configuration, and export to re-structured text. Often, I want to write narrative documentation in Markdown, but combine it with automatically generated function APIs. This module helps you do the latter!

Oh and `myops` means small Sphinx.

## install

Install the command line tool as

```
npm install myops -g
```

## usage

Specify a python module, and any associated options.

## format

Only two forms of docstrings are supported.
